### Hi there - Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I’m Kaan, a Computer Science graduate student at the University of St. Gallen, with a passion for data & deep learning. I have professional experience with BCG and AWS, specializing in AI and GenAI solutions. My current research focuses on using diffusion models for image translation in remote sensing.

#### I’m currently working on: 

🌎 Diffusion Models in Remote Sensing focusing on SAR-to-optical image translation

#### Some of my past projects include:

📚 [Representation Learning for Language Transformers](https://github.com/kaaydin/representation-learning-language-transformers): ### <br>

❓ [Visual Question Answering (VQA) System for Remote Sensing](https://github.com/kaaydin/vqa-remote-sensing): Created a VQA system for interpreting RS images <br>

📑 [Task List Management Application](https://github.com/kaaydin/tapas): Built a Java-based task list management application following Hexagonal Architecture principles <br>

📚 [Eduatar Chatbot](https://github.com/kaaydin/eduatar-chatbot): Designed a chatbot to help users find information about apprenticeships using NLP. <br>

### Hi there - Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

I’m Kaan, a Computer Science graduate student at the University of St. Gallen, with a passion for deep learning. I have professional experience with BCG and AWS, specializing in AI and GenAI solutions. My current research focuses on using diffusion models for image translation in remote sensing.

I’m currently working on: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🌎 Image Translation in Remote Sensing using Diffusion Models to improve SAR-to-optical image translation.

### Some of my past projects include:
🍺 [Drunk Driving Detection Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/kaaydin/drunk-driving-detection): Developed a machine learning model to detect drunk driving from gas sensor data. <br>
📚 [Representation Learning for Language Transformers](https://github.com/kaaydin/representation-learning-language-transformers): ###. <br>
❓ [Visual Question Answering (VQA) System for Remote Sensing](https://github.com/kaaydin/vqa-remote-sensing): Created a VQA system for interpreting remote sensing images through deep learning. <br>
📑 [Task List Management Application](https://github.com/kaaydin/tapas): Built a Java-based task list management application following Hexagonal Architecture principles. <br>
📚 [EduATAR Chatbot](https://github.com/kaaydin/eduatar-chatbot): Designed a chatbot to help users find information about apprenticeships using NLP. <br>
📓 [Automatic Documentation for Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/kaaydin/automatic-notebook-documentation): Automated documentation generation for Jupyter notebooks to enhance efficiency. <br>
